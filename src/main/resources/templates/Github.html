    <h2>What is Git?</h2>
    <p>
        Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

        Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is
        available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.</p>

    <h2>So What Is GitHub, Then?</h2>

    <p>GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it
        a
        lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

        GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub,
        using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

        GitHub is so user-friendly, though, that some people even use GitHub to manage other types of projects – like
        writing books.

        Additionally, anyone can sign up and host a public code repository for free, which makes GitHub especially
        popular
        with open-source projects.

        As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused
        plans that make it easier
        for organizations to manage team members and security. We utilize Github extensively at Kinsta to manage and
        development internal projects.</p>
    <h2>Exploring The GitHub Interface</h2>

    <p>From here, you can view the various branches that are being worked on, as well as when someone made a commit
        (this is kind of like “saving” a file).
        Depending on how a repository is set up, you also might be able to create your own branch and make your own
        commits there.</p>
