This is a collaborative weekly challenge. You will be working with a partner to build out the site and submitting one GitHub repository.

Create a blog site that contains multiple entries about topics we have covered so far in this bootcamp.

Each blog entry should have a date, title and content body.
The home page should display a list of the blog entries. However, the content for each entry is not shown entirely. The user should be able to click a "View Details" or "View More" link from each blog entry that will take them to another page that displays that entire blog entry.
There should be a profile page for the blog authors that includes their names, a short bio, profile photos, and links to their social media sites (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, etc.). The social media links should also include icons representative of which social media platform.
Include a page that describes the bootcamp.
The blog site should have a navigation bar that's present on all pages.
